Counseling Using Speech Emotion Recognition
Overview
This project is designed to analyze and recognize emotions from speech for counseling purposes. It utilizes various Python libraries for speech processing and emotion recognition, and incorporates a chatbot interface to interact with users.

Features
Emotion Recognition: Detects emotions from speech using advanced machine learning models.
Chatbot Interface: Provides an interactive interface for users to communicate and receive responses based on their emotional state.
Speech Processing: Utilizes Python libraries for speech-to-text conversion and feature extraction.
Technologies Used
Python Libraries:
SpeechRecognition for speech-to-text conversion
librosa for audio feature extraction
tensorflow or pytorch for machine learning models
nltk or spaCy for natural language processing
Chatbot Framework: [Include specific library or framework used, e.g., ChatterBot, Rasa]
Machine Learning: [Specify any additional ML libraries or tools used]
